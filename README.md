# Tado API client

This gem implements a simply ruby wrapper around the NON OFFICIAL(!) API of tado.com the company
producing smart thermostats and smart AC controls.

All research on the API was done by http://c-mobberley.com/wordpress/author/hardware\_hacks/
(see http://c-mobberley.com/wordpress/2014/09/28/interacting-with-the-hidden-tado-thermostat-api/).

This is just wrapping this info in ruby.
