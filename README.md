# Tado Thermostat API client

**THIS CODE IS VERY ALPHA, PLEASE DON'T EXPECT IT TO WORK**.

This code implements an UNOFFICIAL ruby wrapper around the API of tado.com the company
producing smart thermostats and smart AC controls.

There is no official documentation about the API. All initial research on the API (1.4) was done by
[hardware_hacks](http://c-mobberley.com/wordpress/author/hardware_hacks/)
(see [interacting with the hidden tado thermostat api](http://c-mobberley.com/wordpress/2014/09/28/interacting-with-the-hidden-tado-thermostat-api/)).

# Current API version

The current (2015/10) version of the API seems to be 1.9. (Though 1.99, 1.999, 1.9999 also work, giving the same result).
2.0 doesn't return anything for the moment.
